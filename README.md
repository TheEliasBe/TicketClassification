# TicketClassification

## Description

This is the repository containing the code for my Master Thesis: "Ticket Classification using Machine Learning".

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- ``notebooks/``: Contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the analysis and visualization of the data.
- ``src/``: Contains the source code for the project.
- ``main_data_collection.py``: Script used to automatically train and evaluate the models.
- ``main.py`` is the main script for the prototype classification API that could be used by the UCC

The required data is not included in this repository. It can be accessed with permission from the UCC.

## Setup and Installation

In order to test the classification system a OpenAI API is required.
The API key needs to be stored in a file at ``conf/base/parameters.yml`
